Getting and Cleaning Data course project
===================

# Running transform

Run run_analysis.R script in the directory containing data downloaded from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

(note you should run it inside "UCI HAR Dataset" folder)

It should generate two files:
  * proccesedMeanStddata.txt - contains tidy data set with columns describing mean and std data of the research
  * averageMeanStddata.txt - contains tidy data set with averaged data for each activity and each subject

# Codebook

CodeBook.MD explains meaning and possible values of resulting columns.
